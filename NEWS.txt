CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS between TYPO3 4.3 and 4.4
(for technical details see ChangeLog)
************************************************************************

General
=======

	* TYPO3 requires PHP 5.2 now

	* The static templates for some basic designs that were part of the TYPO3 Core since TYPO3 3.5 are now moved to a system extension that is not included by default. If you are using one of these templates (GLUECK, GREEN, CANDIDATE etc) or one of the old table-based layouts for rendering content (like content (default) or plaintext rendering), make sure to install the system extension via the TYPO3 Installer.

	* The RTE has undergone major changes as UI components have been transformed into ExtJS widgets:
		1. The RTE framework becomes an ExtJS Panel comprising the toolbar, the iframe, the textarea and the status bar. All components are ExtJS objects.
		2. When BE textareas are resizable, the framework is resizable as a whole. In the FE, the framework is always resizable.
		3. The toolbar dropdowns become ExtJS ComboBoxes.
		4. The context menu becomes a configurable ExtJS Menu.
		5. Color palettes become ExtJS ColorPalettes.
		6. All dialogue windows become ExtJS windows.

	* Automatic version-numbers of CSS and JS files to avoid caching problems: This feature provides automatic numbering of CSS and JS files using the files modified timestamp. This way the file reference will change when a CSS or JS files is changed, and by this the browser and proxy will re-cache the file. Can be configured to include the timestamp within the the filename (before .ext) or as a parameter to the file (default).
	  If versioning is done inside the filename (by setting TYPO3_CONF_VARS[BE][versionNumberInFilename] to true) you need this line as the first rewrite rule in .htaccess:
		# Rule for versioned static files (see TYPO3_CONF_VARS[BE][versionNumberInFilename])
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
		RewriteRule ^(.+)\.(\d+)\.(php|js|css|png|jpg|gif)$ $1.$3 [L]
	  Developers can use this API for versioning of files in the own backend mods, by calling t3lib_div::createVersionNumberedFilename or using the core API for including files in the page renderer class.

Backend
=======

	* It is now possible to add whole directories of CSS files to the backend by setting $TBE_STYLES['stylesheetDirectories'][$_EXTKEY][] = 'EXT:myext/stylesheets/'
